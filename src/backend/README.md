# Getting started

To run the backend locally, do the following:

 - Install dependencies
 - (if not in backend folder) cd backend
 - `py main.py` or `nohup py main.py &` to keep the server running between logins

## Updating the Course_Info.xlsx

If you'd like to run the web scraper, run `scraper.py` after `pip install selenium`. 
(You'll also need a compatible webdriver; any modern version of chrome should work.)

## Dependencies

`pip install pandas numpy Flask webbrowser requests`
