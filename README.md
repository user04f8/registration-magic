(The backend is in Python, an interpreted language, so no building is required)

## Running the project

Open the flutter app and run the backend server.

Flutter
- open the built app available for Windows, Android, or iOS -- for developement, install Flutter and build main.dart, using `flutter pub get` to get dependencies
